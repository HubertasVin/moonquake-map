This is a repository I used to write a tutorial on Medium about how to render a GLTF 3D model using Next.js, TypeScript, react-three-fiber and react-three-drei.

You can check it out [here](https://medium.com/@valentinagaravaglia/rendering-a-3d-model-with-next-js-13-typescript-react-three-fiber-and-react-three-drei-84476c3b6a5d)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!
